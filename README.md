# Recalculated pp

This is a set of lists of ranks (both for scores and players) based on recalculations done approximately the same way osu!tp did them. The strain values for every map and mod combination necessary were calculated with oppai. The pp calculations themselves were rewritten into Ruby for my personal ease of use. The scores won't all be accurate with what oppai says or what the website says, but they should all be within realm of acceptable error.

All of the top 10k players' top 100 performances were taken through osu's API. Some scores are missing in final calculations for various reasons, but very few people are affected in any meaningful way by this.

Each individual score consists of an aim, speed and accuracy rating. This was true for osu!tp, and is true for pp now. The biggest difference is that on osu!tp, these three were kept seperate until the very end. These lists are mostly to sate my curiosity of what the leaderboards would look like if they still were (as I believe they should be).

# Your scores

You can see there's the top 1000 scores in each field, but what about all of your own scores? You can download those all from [http://puu.sh/popb4.zip](http://puu.sh/popb4.zip) (~68MB). In this zip file, you'll find every single score used to calculate the total pp's, all seperated by player and ordered in descending order. These text files are not intended to be read from a text editor, and can be copy-pasted into, say, excel. The format of each of the scores is:  
"play details [tab] total pp [tab] aim pp [tab] speed pp [tab] acc pp".
